## About

JRobo is an advanced IRC bot that uses its own IRC framework. It was written from scratch.

# Features

## Install and run

# Linux

Requirements
 * Java Apache Ant (Recommended but optional)
 * OpenJDK

# Windows

You're on your own.

## Develop

This works best under Netbeans, but you can choose a different development environment. It is recommended to use my custom build.xml to include Google's GSON for JSON library and other jar libraries bundled with JRobo.jar.

    $ cd ~/NetbeansProjects
    $ git clone https://github.com/BullShark/JRobo.git

OR:

From Netbean, use the Git plugin to clone this Netbeans project.
